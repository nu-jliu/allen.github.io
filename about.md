### Jingkun (Allen) Liu

I'm a graduate of Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology, where I earned a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering and Computer Science in 2022, along with minors in Multidisciplinary Robotics and Dynamic Systems and Control. After graduation, I spent a year at DEKA R&D, Corp., where I developed software for autonomous delivery and security robots. My responsibilities included deploying the embedded bonding software for multi-channel modems and enhancing the robot's functionality with error-logging and hardware monitoring capabilities using ROS.

Driven by a passion for cutting-edge technologies across software, electrical, and mechanical fields, I decided to further my education by pursuing a Masterâ€™s in Robotics at Northwestern University. During my studies, I engaged with a variety of robotic technologies such as robotic manipulation, SLAM, autonomous navigation, and machine learning. I am set to graduate with my M.S. in Robotics in December 2024. My academic and professional experiences have equipped me with a robust set of skills and a commitment to contributing to the advancement of the robotics field.
