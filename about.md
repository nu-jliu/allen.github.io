### Jingkun (Allen) Liu

I graduated from Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology in 2022 with a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering and Computer Science and minors in Multidisiplinary Robotics and Dynamic Systems and Control. After graduating I spent 1 year developing autonomous delivery and security robot for DEKA R&D, Co. During my time with DEKA, I deployed the .

My passion to continue working with cutting edge technologies in the software, electrical, and mechanical realms led me to pursue a Masterâ€™s in Robotics at Northwestern University. While at Northwestern, I worked with a myriad of robotic technologies, including robotic manipulation, SLAM, autonomous navigation, and machine learning. I graduated with my M.S. in Robotics in December 2023.

I'm now developing flight software at Astrobotic to power lunar rovers and improve our access to the moon.
