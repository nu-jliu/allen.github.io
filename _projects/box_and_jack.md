# Project Description
Used Jupyter notebook to perform the calculation about physics model of a jack with a box with some force applied upon the box.

# Structure

## Rigit Body Transformation

To model the dynamics about the jack and the box, we defined all necessary frames as shown in figure below:

Then we can calculate the transformation between all frames:

## Euler-Language Equation Formulation

In this project, to simplify the problem, we model the jack as 4 point mass with same mass, `m_j`, and model the box with the mass `m_b` and moment of intertia of `I_b`, so that the total kinetic energy and potential energy can be easily obtained by this

# Challenges
 - *Solver algorithm*: When first implementing the algorithm for two solvers, it was difficult for us to understand the concept for the solver so we spent most of time drawing the process on a paper to visualize it. After we had a clear concept about what it was it was a smooth process for all of us. -->
